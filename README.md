# Big-Data-Visualization-Made-Easy

Description – This project aims to visualize humongous raw data which consists of US road traffic volume for the year 2015. This ~2gb dataset contains daily volumes of traffic, binned by the hour. The data used has the following fields: daily observation of traffic volume divided into 24 hourly bins, station ID, traffic flow direction, and type of road. 

Implementation -
•	Data pre-processing and transformation is done in Python.
•	Visualization is done using D3.js along with other libraries like datamaps, d3-svg-legend, d3-tooltip, and bootstrap (CDN). 
•	The final product is a dynamic dashboard that provides multiple visualizations of US Road Traffic Data with a meta-overview using heatmap and macro views using bar chart, line graph, dynamic bubble and pie-chart.
